## Fully Usermode Modules Detector

### What is this?
This solution is not something supernatural. \
With this we will be able to detect modules in our process that were unauthorized loaded into our memory.

### How's this works?
- enumerate the loaded modules in the process
- check if any non-whitelisted modules were found

### Features:
- [x] Enumerating modules
- [x] Whitelist modules
- [x] Waiting for loaded modules
